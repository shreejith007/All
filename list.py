## list is basically  a container of the variable which is almost similar  like an array;
item=[1,2,3]
print(item)

item[0]="Shreejith"
 # type: ignore## so here we have given the index [0]for the name shreejith 
print(item)
product=["harry",2,3]
print(product)
product[1]="shub"
print(product)
##tupel is used to make the value static it is used ( we cannot change the  values in the tuple)
tup1=(1,2,3)
## tup1[0]=2   (here the compiler will show the error becz the  tup1 will only show the static value inside the )
print(tup1)
